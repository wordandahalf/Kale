## Kale ANTLR Grammar
The parsing and lexing of Kale is handled by ANTLR.
Due to limitations of Kotlin/Native, it only supports interop with C libraries.
Since ANTLR4 does not support C as a target, ANTLR3 must be used.

### Structure
- `Kale.g` is the ANTLR3 combined lexer and grammar definitions
- `include/` contains the header files generated by ANTLR3
- `src/` contains the C source files generated by ANTLR3
- `lib/` contains the compiled static library

### Building
Building `lib/libkale.a` is simple:
- Install ANTLR3c v3.5.1
- `gcc -c -g -ggdb -fPIC -rdynamic src/*.c -Iinclude/ -L/usr/local/lib -lantlr3c`
- `ar rcs lib/libkale.a *.o`
